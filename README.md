# Panopto Video Downloader
A simple extension for Google Chrome that allows you to download videos from Panopto for later viewing.

HOW TO USE: Navigate to the Panopto video itself you want to download, click the download icon (next to your user picture) and choose where you want the video to be saved.

NOTE: This will be updated/improved if and when I have time. I may work on a Firefox extension in the future.
